Abstract
Corals that exhibit higher heat stress resilience through mechanisms that include bleaching resistance, survival without algal endosymbionts lost during bleaching, and effective recovery of symbiont populations after heat stress, are more likely to persist and reproduce in future warmer ocean climates. However, it is imperative to determine whether stress resilient corals have reduced fitness of other physiological traits and how resilience is inherited through generations. We investigated links between thermal tolerance, recovery, and growth in two generations of the reef-building coral, Montipora capitata. We measured growth for 3 months under ambient temperature and then conducted a two-week heat stress experiment, in which samples were removed after photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) declined â‰¥ 30%. We found a positive relationship between thermal tolerance and growth, but moderately tolerant corals had the highest baseline growth, suggesting a nuanced tradeoff between traits. Highly tolerant corals were also more likely to survive during recovery. A subset of these adult corals was spawned to produce an F1 generation, in which we evaluated growth and heat tolerance in juveniles. Juvenile heat tolerance, but not growth, was positively correlated with parental tolerance. These results provide further insight into tradeoffs associated with heat stress resilience and heritability of heat tolerance.
