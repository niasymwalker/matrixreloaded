Abstract

Coral heat stress resilience includes mechanisms to resist bleaching, survive without algal endosymbionts lost during bleaching, and recover symbiont populations after heat stress. Certain algal endosymbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae) may also confer additional heat stress resilience to the coral holobiont. We investigated links between thermal tolerance and recovery, growth, and symbiont genus in two generations of the reef-building coral, Montipora capitata. We measured 3 months of growth under ambient temperature conditions and then conducted a two-week heat stress experiment, in which samples were removed after exhibiting a â‰¥ 30% decline in photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm). Higher tolerant corals were dominated by Durusdinium spp. rather than Cladocopium spp. symbionts. We found a positive relationship between thermal tolerance and surface area growth, but that moderately tolerant corals had the highest baseline growth, suggesting a nuanced tradeoff between traits. Highly tolerant corals were also more likely to survive during recovery. A subset of these adult corals was spawned to produce an F1 generation, in which we evaluated growth and heat tolerance in juveniles. Juvenile heat tolerance was significantly higher in Durusdinium-dominated corals and positively correlated with parental tolerance. These results provide further insight into tradeoffs associated with heat stress resilience and heritability of heat tolerance.
